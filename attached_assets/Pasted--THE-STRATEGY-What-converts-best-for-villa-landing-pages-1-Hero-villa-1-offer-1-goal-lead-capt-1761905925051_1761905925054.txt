✅ THE STRATEGY
What converts best for villa landing pages:

1 Hero villa

1 offer

1 goal (lead capture or booking call)

No fluff. No menus. No distractions.

💡 LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE (Mockup + Script)

I'll break this into sections, exactly how you or a web designer can build it — in WordPress, Webflow, GoHighLevel, or Carrd.

🔝 SECTION 1 – “HOOK + CREDIBILITY + CTA”

[Full-screen background video or image of the villa — drone footage of paddle court, pool, or sunset]

📸 SECTION 2 – “VISUAL TOUR (TRUST)”

[Carousel or grid of 8–10 high-impact images]

Bali stone heated pool

Paddle court in action

Basketball court with sunset lighting

Outdoor TV setup

Private chef plating dishes

Gym shots

6 beautiful ensuite bedrooms

Mercedes Vito arrival

🖼 Each image should have a caption, e.g.

“Your own heated Bali stone pool — 30° year-round”
“Play paddle under the Moroccan sun”
“Stream Netflix poolside or catch the match outdoors”

💬 SECTION 3 – “WHO THIS IS FOR”

Use Hormozi-style value targeting.

This villa is perfect for:
✅ Family trips with active teens
✅ Sports teams or corporate retreats
✅ Groups of friends who want sun, fun, and total privacy
✅ Clients used to Dubai-style service — but at ⅓ of the price

🧠 SECTION 4 – “THE EXPERIENCE”

Use emotional and sensory language.

Wake up to fresh mint tea by the pool.
Play a paddle match before your chef-prepared breakfast.
Train in your private gym while your friends shoot hoops.
Watch the sunset over the Atlas Mountains — from your heated pool.

Everything is handled. From airport pickup to club bookings — we manage it all.

💸 SECTION 5 – “PRICE, AVAILABILITY + INCENTIVE”

Use urgency + incentive.
